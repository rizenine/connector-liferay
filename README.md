Liferay REST Connector

This is a work-in-progress REST connector for [Evolveum Midpoint](https://wiki.evolveum.com/). There already exist a [SOAP](https://github.com/Evolveum/connector-liferay) based connector. This project is for my learning and because I prefer to use REST and JSON. :)

Things that work:

 - Add/Update/Delete User
 - Add/Update/Delete Roles
